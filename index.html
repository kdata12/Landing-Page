            <div class="text"> Once upon a time, in the land of Asgard, there lived a mighty warrior named Thor. He was the son of Odin, the king of the gods, and was known for his strength and bravery.

                Thor wielded a powerful hammer called Mjolnir, which he used to protect Asgard and the other realms from the forces of evil. He was feared and respected by all who knew of him. </div>
